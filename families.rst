Peppler
-------

I found the Familysearch.org `Pedigree chart for Johann Jacob Peppler <https://familysearch.org/tree/pedigree/KXVY-ZL4/landscape>`_ by searching https://familysearch.org/tree/find/name. 
It goes back several generations more than my current Peppler tree and details the date of marriage, and so on. It was discovered by searching Family Tree's on familysearch.org
using Johann Jacob's birth and death dates and locations. For birth location, familysearch.org detected Rodheim, and then presented a pull down that included Biebertal. I also
supplied the place of burial, and his wife's name, Maria Magdalene Platt.

The land of "J. P", likely Johann Jacob Peppler, is shown on the **Adams Twp, Allen Co., 1860 Plat Map**. It is locatd in section 36, in the bottom right corner, of the 1860 Plat Map of Adams Township. The Genealogy Center's Pathfinder has a `page dedicated to the 
list of Allen County Plat map books <http://genealogycenter.org/Pathfinders/AllenINGuides/PlatMaps.aspx>`_ avaiable in the Genealogy Center. The first map is from 1855. The ACGSI also has Allen County Plat maps online at

This `ACGSI 1860 Plat Maps for Allen County <https://www.acgsi.org/maps/1860plat.php>`_ shows "J.P." as the owner. The `June 11, 1857 deed for Jacob Pepler <https://www.ancestry.com/mediaui-viewer/collection/1030/tree/68081704/person/38179109106/media/3577b3f5-3ce0-456a-8948-611099d3904e?_phsrc=Ysx46&usePUBJs=true>`_ shows him to be the owner.

In the 1878 Map of Adams Township, which I believe is a Plat map, that I obtained from the Jenny Morrison Koenig Tree, it shows "J. Pepler" in section 36 of Adams Twp.

See :ref:`allen-county-deed-search-online` to search Deed Indexes for Allen County, Indiana, online.

The `Townships of Allen County <https://www.acgsi.org/maps/township.php>`_ gives the Allen county township PLSS designations used in Land Records and shows Adams Township is **30 North, Range 11 East**. Since I believe Johann Jacob Peppler settled in section 36 (of 
Adams Township, as the 1860 Census shows), where the 1860 Plat Map of Adams townships shows a **J.P.** residing (which is near or adjacent to a Bender property), we know when searching the `Allen County Deeds index online <https://indiana-countyrecorders-records.com/User/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f>`_
for, say, the years between 1851 and 1859, the **J.P.** property would be recorded as in **Section 36, Township 30, Range 14**, or simply as **\|36\|30\|13\|** in the Section, Township, Range columns of the deed index(which are among the right-most columns on the
second page). And searching the Section, Township, and Range columns is much faster when trying find to find an ancestor's name.

    "...He came to this country when he was 15 years of age, **the family settling in Fort Wayne, where the subject of this sketch was engaged in the tailoring business with his father.** He was married in 1860 and for
    some time lived in Preble township, going later to Union Township, where he has since lived...."

Behrmann
--------

Fritz Behrman
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

According to Genny Koenig Morrison's Tree(or an email conversation), "Fritz" arrived in the USA with his family and Heinrich, who is on the same ship with his family, 
was his nephew. Genny might have indicated that some think Fritz was the father not the uncle.

Farm Land Location
++++++++++++++++++

The 1860 census shows Heinrich Behrman ("Bearman" is the spelling in the census, I believe) lives in Adams township, Allen Co., Indiana. The 1860 Plat appears to show a name like "Bearman" in section 25 of Adams township. This can probably be confirmed by comparing
the surnames of his neighborrs listed in the 1860 census and then examining the plat map more closely with a magnifying glass. Once his farm is located on the plat map of Adams township, the deed will give the date of ownership and exact location within Adams township.

Origin Discrepencies:
+++++++++++++++++++++

The Morrison Koenig Tree entry for `Heinrich Friedrich August Beerman <https://www.ancestry.com/family-tree/person/tree/3876324/person/-1437171861/facts>`_ gives his
place of origin as **Ottenstein, Holzminden, Niedersachen, Germany** whereas the early censuses give **Brunswick** or **Braunschweig**. Brunswick is the English equivalent
of Braunschweig, a city in Niedersachsen located to the east of Hannover. Ottenstein is also in Niedersachsen, but it is not near Braunschweig. It is rather to the south
of Hannover, near the south-eastern border of Niedersachsen.

Question: Was Brunswick/Braunschweig possibly larger in 1854?

Arrival Discrepencies:
++++++++++++++++++++++

.. todo:: Clarify these arrival descrepencies and provide links for every citation mentioned.

There are two arrival dates for Heinrich Behrman and family found in the U.S. Censuses, either 1836 or 1854.  The 1836 date is deduced from the 1900 Census, which gives his years
in the US as 64. It shows Heinrich Behrman is a naturalized citizen by 1900, and both he and his wife, Jutina L Behrman, have lived in the US 64 years: 

Henry Behrman 1900 census: Immigration Year 1836; Num of Years in US: ??; Birth date: Apr 1830

   ================= === 
   Name    	     Age

   Elvine J Adam      1
   Justina L Behrman 69
   Henry Behrman     70
   Charles Behrman   23
   ================= ===

Her country of origin is given as **Switzerland**. However, the 1860 Census for `Henry and Josephine Bearman or Bearmand <http://interactive.ancestry.com/7667/4215010_00310/8194484?backurl=http://person.ancestry.com/tree/68081704/person/38177107690/facts/citation/241747451740/edit/record>`_  
also seems to show both his and Josephine's country of origin as **Switzerland**. So is this the person I think? 

The other censuses from 1860, 1870, 1880, 1900 give this information:

The June 23, 1854 `O Thyen (or Thijen) passenger list <http://interactive.ancestry.com/7488/NYM237_141-0351?pid=1070690&backurl=http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?indiv%3D1%26dbid%3D7488%26h%3D1070690%26ssrc%3Dpt%26tid%3D68081704%26pid%3D38177096033%26usePUB%3Dtrue&ssrc=pt&treeid=68081704&personid=38177096033&hintid=&usePUB=true&usePUBJs=true>`_
is not very legibly. The name **Heinr** is hard to make out. 

Immigrant ships also has the passenger list transcription for the `O Thyen <http://immigrantships.net/v4/1800v4/othyen18540623.html>`_ that arrived June 23, 1854 from
Bremen.

Thoughts on Resolution of Arrival Discrepancy
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The O Thijen/O Thyen Passenger List for New York arrival of **Heinr Behrman** is handwritten and not umabiguous. The arrival date of "June 23" could also be read "June 28", and
the year of 1854 could read as 1858. "Heinr" is also not real clear, either, though as good as any other guess. 

We can take the entries for Fritz Behrman on this same O Thijen list and those of his family members and use his census date and those of his family members, as well
as those of Heinrich and his family members and see if the calculated date of arrival from the censuses corresponds to 1854. Since we suspect that Fritz and Heinrich
are related, we can see whether they both settled in Allen County or whether Fritz and his family attended Sankt Johannis Geheimnis or Soest Emmanual. We want a the
census dates to correspond with the arrival date.

Frederich Behrman Issues

There is a Frederich Bearman, who I believe arrived on the same ship with Heinrich Behrman/Bearman, who lives in either Adams or Jefferson county, starting in at least
, if I recall, 1880. He is still there, near Mary Bearman (Behrman) Gable and her husband Daniel Gable, as well as Louis (John L in census) Peppler.

In 1930 `census <http://interactive.ancestry.com/7602/004118575_00652/15453749?backurl=http%3a%2f%2fsearch.ancestry.com%2fcgi-bin%2fsse.dll%3fdb%3d1900usfedcen%26h%3d15453749%26ti%3d0%26indiv%3dtry%26gss%3dpt%26ssrc%3dpt_t10996284_p190548256_kpidz0q3d190548256z0q26pgz0q3d32768z0q26pgplz0q3dpid&ssrc=pt_t10996284_p190548256_kpidz0q3d190548256z0q26pgz0q3d32768z0q26pgplz0q3dpid&backlabel=ReturnRecord>`_, Mary K Bearman (or Behrman) Gable and Daniel Gable live next door to the son of Frederich Bearman.

Bearman's birth on 17-Apr-1830, baptism on 25-Apri-1830, and marriage to Hanne Justine Louise Caroline Gieberl on 16-Mar-1854. The citation details mentions transcription in PDF of:

    format. All information is from the original, hand-written church books in Ottenstein. Any translation by Delores Lorene.:

However, Dolly told me that there is no PDF:

    Kurt:

    I went through the materials that I have and I don't have a pdf for Ottenstein. I have a 4th cousin who lives about 5 miles from Ottenstein. He knows a guy who has access to the Ottenstein records. The guy sent me information from the Church Book but not a copy of the CHurch Book itself.  Whatever, I put on the internet is all I had.  I think I am correct. I don't remember if I remember correctly or
    not but I think so. Let me know if you have questions.
