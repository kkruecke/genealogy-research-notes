After going to `BLM Naviagtor <https://navigator.blm.gov/map>`_, then do -> Toolbox -> PLSS Tools -> Add 'PLSS CadNSDI Layer' to Map. Also select **Get Lat/Long from Land Description**. Next, choose State of Indina, 2nd Meridian, the Township number, Range number, and
section number. Then click 'Find Land Description from Location', and it will take you to that section, township and range.

* `INDIANA COUNTY RECORDERS PORTAL - Land & Indexed Records <https://indiana-countyrecorders-records.com>`_ has Allen County Deed index books searchable by suranme. You can sign in as Guest. The three columns for Section, Township, and Range, located far right side of
  the right-hand page. I believe, if you know from, say, a Platt map, the Section and range, you can use these three columns for browsing through the index more quickly than simply reading through the entire Index for that first letter of the suranme.

The U.S. Geological Survey websit's article `The Public Land Survey System (PLSS) <https://nationalmap.gov/small_scale/a_plss.html>`_ gives illustrations and explain the meaning of the numbers in the table. It explains:  

    Each township is identified with a township and range designation. Township designations indicate the location north or south of the baseline, and range designations indicate the location east or west of the Principal Meridian. For example, a township might
    be identified as Township 7 North, Range 2 West, which would mean that it was in the 7th tier of townships north of a baseline, and in the 2nd column of townships west of a principal meridian.  A legal land description of a section includes the State, Principal
    Meridian name, Township and Range designations with directions, and the section number: Nebraska, Sixth Principal Meridian T7N, R2W, sec5.
