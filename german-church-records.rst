=============================

Process
-------

3. Archion (Paid German site for German Protestant Records)

Prior to WWI, a differ handwritten cursive script was used that must be deciphered. After WWII, a different handwritten script was taught, and therefore most German today cannot read
the old handwriting. So you will need to familiarize yourself with this old script somewhat. Some helpful books include:

1. If I can You Can Decipher Germanic Records by Edna M. Bentz
2. Tip and Tricks of Deciphering German Handwriting
3. Deciphering Handwriting in German Documents
4. German English Geneaological Dictionary

Important Points on German Church Records
-----------------------------------------

Church records were written chronological order in the book, so January births (marriages, and deaths) will come first and December will come last.

As we know, the "in" word ending means "female", but scribes would add the "in" to the end of surnames to indicate the individual was female.
